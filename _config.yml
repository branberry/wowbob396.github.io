# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values

# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.

# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Hello stranger, and welcome to my blog. 
  I intend to use this as a repository of my thoughts on developing different software ranging from web development to AI. 
  I don't claim to be an expert in any topic, but I hope to use this blog as a way for me to keep track of my programming progress and hopefully create useful tidbits of information for someone.

baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "www.lostcoding.com" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g.LostInCode.com
