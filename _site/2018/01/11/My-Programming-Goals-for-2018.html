<p>2017 for me was a very successful year in many ways.  It was successful for me because my first internship allowed me to grow substantially as a software developer and
as a person.  Not only did I really push myself on difficult programming situations, I learned how to communicate effectively with my co-workers and superiors.  These skills are all invaluable.</p>

<p>Not only did I grow on the technical side, my passion for software development has also grown.  One aspect of computer science I feared entering into college was that I would lack the passion and drive to be a part of it or that I wouldn’t be successful.  The internship answered both of these questions for me and it made me realize that I don’t need to have a natural aptitude for programming to find success in programming.  What I discovered was having confidence in what you can become to be the single most important factor.  Once you are confident in the fact that you can become successful, you work much harder to achieve that success.  Before my internship, I was terrified that I would be so lost and would not be able to keep up with the pressure of being a software engineer intern.  I distinctly remember my boss interviewing me stating: “if you need your hand held the whole time, don’t expect to do well here”.  He said it in a stern and intimidating way and I carried a sense of fear with me from the moment I started.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I am glad he told me this as it gave me a healthy amount of anxiety and I did what I could to prepare for work.  After work started, I would go home and start learning other technology stacks on the side to continue to grow outside of work.  Although I am happy with the progress I have made, I am painfully aware of the fact that there is much more for me to learn and there is plenty of room for me to grow.  This is both a daunting, and yet, exciting prospect.  It is daunting because the enormity of things to learn and figuring out what is even worth learning, but exciting because I believe I can carve a path that will lead me to success and fulfillment.</p>

<p>I started this blog as a way to document my thoughts on this journey of not only a software developer, but to document my life and have it to look back upon.</p>
