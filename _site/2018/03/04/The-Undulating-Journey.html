        <p>#The Undulating Journey</p>

<p>One thing I have learned as I have grown older, and I think something everyone learns, is that very few things in life are black or white.  Very rarely is the journey of life a straight forward path.</p>

<p>Starting off, I had very little genuine interest and had no direction when it came to computer science or software development.  It wasn’t until I had the opportunity for a software engineering internship did my passion truly grow.  With the passion came understanding; I began to understand concepts in class that appeared arcane to me, and I am to develop code that seemed impossible before. I am still barely above a novice level, but I have come a long way from where I have started.</p>

<p>The most rewarding part of all of this, though, is how applicable software development and computer science is to my everyday life.  It is as though every problem I am faced becomes a problem that I can solve algorithmically.  I am currently reading Algorithms to Live By, and this book does an excellent job of crystallizing this notion.  The book is a fantastic read for anyone even tangentially interested in computers or software.</p>

<p>As I continue to grow my software development skills, I have learned the importance of having a healthy mind.  The mind is a part of the body, and therefore to have a healthy mind, you must have a healthy body.  I have noted that periods of physical neglect have been accompanied with periods of decreased productivity with relation to homework and personal projects.  Not only do I notice decreased productivity, I notice many other negative psychological effects such as anxiety, poor mood, and irritability.  I have always been someone who exercises consistently, but software development has changed the way I even view exercise.  Before, it was a very competitive activity for me as I would always try to lift the most in whatever exercise I was doing.  It was a very toxic mentality for sure.  I would have less-than-optimal exercises just so I could show off, to people who most likely didn’t give a shit, just so I could get an ego boost.  Now, I see exercise simply as a way to keep my mind sharp and improve my wellbeing.  I still workout with a fairly high intensity, but I do much more cardio than I did before.  I no longer focus on the superficial aspects of exercise which has made working out more enjoyable, as now I see it as a fun activity and a personal challenge as opposed to showing off.</p>

<p>Although I am still young (as of today I am 22), the transitory phase from a teenager to an adult teaches you so much.  For me, growing older has been an incredibly humbling and eye-opening.  In my opinion, perspective has been the most powerful teacher.  As a teenager, you tend to be more myopic.  I believed in high school that success meant being a great athlete or being popular like so many kids in high school.  In high school, it is very easy to be caught up in superficial desires which can be hard to shake as you grow older.  I have found that seeking external validation is addicting, but again, toxic.  Especially in an age of social media, external validation has become a shallow high that is trivially easy to pursue and continue to obtain.  Reading about the negative effects this can have on wellbeing as made me avoid social media altogether.</p>

<p>I still have plenty of room to grow as a person.  Life’s greatest pleasure, for me, is the aspect of growth.  There are so many facets to life and so many skills to improve upon.  Software development has taught me that learning is something you must never stop doing.</p>

        <p>Hello stranger, and welcome to my blog.  I intend to use this as a repository of my thoughts on developing different software ranging from web development to AI.  I don&#39;t claim to be an expert in any topic, but I hope to use this blog as a way for me to keep track of my programming progress and hopefully create useful tidbits of information for someone.</p>
