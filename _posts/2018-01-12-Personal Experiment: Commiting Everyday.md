# Personal Experiment: Commiting Everyday

In the spirit of my previous post,  I thought I would write about a mode of action for achieving further growth.  This probably isn't fairly uncommon, but I want to make one meaningful commit a day. 

What constitutes a meaningful commit?  Well, it is trivially easy to make a tiny change and push that here and there, but I believe that the changes should have some impact on the project that I am working on.
