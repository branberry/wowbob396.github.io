# Lessons From Suffering

Suffering is something every living creature is confronted with at some point in their lives.  Whether it be from bereavement or humiliation, suffering takes on all sorts of shapes and forms.
Suffering is often a senseless occurrence, and one that simply leaves one worse off than before.  Even in senseless suffering, though, one can still draw salient lessons from them.  Suffering, even in the most
mindless and dull, at the very least, lends insight into how one could avoid senseless suffering.

## Senseless suffering is an experience I live through, and see regularly.

Often I see immediate family members in the abyss of despair; unable to deal with aging and all of its maladies, and constantly fighting the ever forward march of time. She struggles to parse 
our mortal existence.  Filled with empathy for my relative, I live their pain as well, and I have learned to understand it deeply.  My experience has been greatly shaped by the understanding of aging, and all of the
senseless suffering it besieges us with.  Mortality is a difficult notion to reconcile in ones mind, but more painful is to fight mortality at every turn.  In my family member's despair, I have learned a powerful lesson:
That one must be able to confront, and accept the ephemeralilty of their lives.  To understand the very nature of our existence; one that we have not chosen, but still, have to reconcile.  An existence that is transitory and brief.
The brevity of life is a powerful teacher; it reorients the way one chooses to live their life, and what to spend their time on.  The shortness of live, if you pay attention, conveys to you that time is the ultimate currency;
of which all other experiences are built upon.  Use your time wisely, as you will never get it back.
